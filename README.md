## Overview

FIL-Frame is a monorepo that includes two main packages:

`hardhat`: Manages the blockchain-related aspects, including smart contract development, deployment, and testing.

`nextjs`: Handles the frontend and API aspects of the project using Next.js.

This repository is designed to be a quickstart for developers new to the Filecoin ecosystem, providing various integration options to suit different needs.

## Unique Features

FIL-Frame unlocks several unique features that make it an ideal starting point for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the Filecoin network:

- On-Chain File Storage Deals: FIL-Frame enables developers to create and manage file storage deals directly on the blockchain (FVM) via smart contracts. This ensures transparency, security, and immutability for storage transactions.

- Seamless Integration with FVM: The repository provides built-in support for Filecoin's EVM compatible network, allowing developers to easily interact with the Filecoin network and leverage its decentralized storage capabilities, using tooling they're already familiar with.

- Multiple Storage Onramp Options: FIL-Frame offers various storage onramp options, including Lighthouse, Storacha and Akave, giving developers the flexibility to choose the solution that best fits their needs.

- Comprehensive Smart Contract Management: With Hardhat integration, developers can efficiently develop, deploy, and test smart contracts, easing the workflow for developers.

- User-Friendly Frontend: The Next.js frontend provides a modern and responsive interface for interacting with the blockchain, making it easier for users to engage with the dApp.

These features make FIL-Frame a powerful and versatile tool for developers entering the Filecoin ecosystem, providing all the necessary components to build robust and scalable decentralized applications.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#installation)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)

### Installation

### From source code

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fil-frame
cd fil-frame 
```

2. (Optional) Switch to a different starter kit branch.
 
Available branches include:

`lighthouse-nfts`: Integration with Lighthouse for decentralized storage.

`storacha-nfts`: Integration with Storacha for decentralized storage.

`akave-integration`: Integration with Akave for decentralized storage.

3. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### Configuration

1. Copy the sample environment files, and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp packages/hardhat/.env.example packages/hardhat/.env
cp packages/nextjs/.env.example packages/nextjs/.env.local
```

2. Update the environment variables in the `.env` files with your own values.

## Using the CLI

The `create-filecoin-app` CLI tool helps you quickly set up a Filecoin-ready repository. It offers two modes: interactive mode and flag mode.

#### Interactive Mode

To use the interactive mode, simply run:

```bash
npx create-filecoin-app
```

You will be prompted to answer a series of questions to configure your new project. This includes your project name, and selecting your preferred storage onramp option (Lighthouse, Storacha, or Akave).

#### Flag Mode

If you prefer to skip the prompts, you can use the flag mode to specify your options directly. For example, to initialise a project named `my-app`, with lighthouse as the storage onramp:

```bash
npx create-filecoin-app my-app --lighthouse
```

This command initializes a new repository named `my-app` with Lighthouse as the storage onramp.

The flags available currently include:

- `--lighthouse`: this initializes a project using lighthouse as the storage onramp
- `--storacha`: this initializes a project using storacha as the storage onramp
- `--akave`: this initializes a project using akave as the storage onramp

#### Storage Onramp Options

- **Lighthouse**: Decentralized storage solution for NFTs and other data.
- **Storacha**: Decentralized hot storage network - the dazzling revitalization of Web3.Storage.
- **Akave**: L2 storage chain powering on-chain data lakes for scalable, secure, and cost-effective data management.

After running the CLI, your new project will be set up and ready for development with your chosen storage onramp.

### Configuration

1. Copy the sample environment files, and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp packages/hardhat/.env.example packages/hardhat/.env
cp packages/nextjs/.env.example packages/nextjs/.env.local
```

2. Update the environment variables in the `.env` files with your own values. (Note that the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` value is optional)

## Usage

### Deploying Smart Contracts

To compile and deploy the smart contracts:

```bash
yarn compile
yarn deploy
```

### Running the Frontend

To start the Next.js frontend:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at
[`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/)

*Fil-Frame, with the Lighthouse integration.*

## Storage Onramp Options

### Lighthouse

The repository includes a template which makes use of Lighthouse for decentralized storage, and is available in the `lighthouse-nfts` branch.

To use this integration:

1. Login to [Lighthouse](https://files.lighthouse.storage/) and generage an lighthouse API key.
2. Ensure you add the Lighthouse API key set in your `.env.local` file:
`LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_lighthouse_api_key`
3. then you can started the fil-frame app with command:
`yarn dev`
4. Use the provided integration to upload files to Lighthouse

### Storacha

The repository includes a template which makes use of Storacha for uploading files and directories to IPFS.

To use this integration:

1. Switch to the `storacha-nfts` branch:
   - To switch the active branch to the `storacha-nfts` branch, run:
  
  ```bash
  git checkout storacha-nfts
  ```

2. Deploy Your NFT Contract:
   - Follow the instructions in the [Hardhat README](packages/hardhat/README.md) (in the storacha-nfts branch) to deploy your NFT contract on the Calibration network.

3. Set Up Your Application:
   - Navigate to the [Next.js README](packages/nextjs/README.md) to set up your application for uploading files and directories using Storacha.

4. Using Storacha Functionalities:
   - If you only need the functionalities to upload files to Storacha, complete the setup in the [Next.js README](packages/nextjs/README.md).
   - Copy the `app/api` folder from [packages/nextjs/app/api](packages/nextjs/app/api).
   - Include the Storacha hooks from [packages/nextjs/hooks/storacha](packages/nextjs/hooks/storacha).
   - Integrate the frontend code for file inputs from [storachaUpload.tsx](packages/nextjs/app/storacha/_components/storachaUpload.tsx).

* Ensure you have the necessary dependencies and configurations as outlined in the respective README files.

### Akave
To use fil-frame with Akave integration, you need to follow the instructions to setup the env to use Akave to store data for your projects.
- Make sure you install and run docker in your machine.
- Pull the **akavelink** docker image using `docker pull akave/akavelink:latest`.
- Run the docker container to spin up a Akave local api endpoint that can be used for bucket and file operations. Learn more on [Akave docs](https://hackathon-docs.akave.ai/js-docker-example-code).
  ```
  docker run -d \
    -p 8000:3000 \
    -e NODE_ADDRESS="connect.akave.ai:5500" \
    -e PRIVATE_KEY="your_wallet_private_key" \
    akave/akavelink:latest
  ```
- In case you're using a different port for your api make sure you update `AKAVE_BACKEND_URL` in your .env file.

To learn more how to use Akave to create bucket and upload  on front-end, visit [Akave docs](https://hackathon-docs.akave.ai/js-docker-example-code#bucket-operations).

## Filecoin DealClient Onramp Contract Page

This MVP is built using [fil-frame](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fil-frame), and it demonstrates how to onboard data to Filecoin via a onchain data onramp contracts integreate with Pinata deal engine to process storage on Filecoin.

Here is the walkthrough of setting up the project and perform data prep and upload the files:
- Follow the the above [instructions](#installation) to setup the project locally.
- Login to [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) account and ensure you add the Pinata JWT key set in your `packages/nextjs/.env.local` file: `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_jwt_key`.
  
### To compile and deploy the smart contracts:

```bash
yarn compile
yarn deploy --network calibration
```
### To start the Next.js frontend:

```bash
yarn dev
```

or

```bash
npm run dev
```
The deal client page will be available at
[`http://localhost:3000/dealClient`](http://localhost:3000/dealClient)
