## Overview üåê

FIL-Frame is a monorepo that includes two main packages:

`hardhat`: Manages the blockchain-related aspects, including smart contract development, deployment, and testing.

`nextjs`: Handles the frontend and API aspects of the project using Next.js.

This repository is designed to be a quickstart for developers new to the Filecoin ecosystem, providing various integration options to suit different needs.

## Unique Features

FIL-Frame unlocks several unique features that make it an ideal starting point for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the Filecoin network:

- On-Chain File Storage Deals: FIL-Frame enables developers to create and manage file storage deals directly on the blockchain (FVM) via smart contracts. This ensures transparency, security, and immutability for storage transactions.

- Seamless Integration with FVM: The repository provides built-in support for Filecoin's EVM compatible network, allowing developers to easily interact with the Filecoin network and leverage its decentralized storage capabilities, using tooling they're already familiar with.

- Multiple Storage Onramp Options: FIL-Frame offers various storage onramp options, including Lighthouse, Storacha and Akave, giving developers the flexibility to choose the solution that best fits their needs.

- Comprehensive Smart Contract Management: With Hardhat integration, developers can efficiently develop, deploy, and test smart contracts, easing the workflow for developers.

- User-Friendly Frontend: The Next.js frontend provides a modern and responsive interface for interacting with the blockchain, making it easier for users to engage with the dApp.

These features make FIL-Frame a powerful and versatile tool for developers entering the Filecoin ecosystem, providing all the necessary components to build robust and scalable decentralized applications.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#installation)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)

### Installation

### From source code

### From source code

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fil-frame
cd fil-frame 
```

2. (Optional) Switch to a different starter kit branch
Available branches include:

`lighthouse-nfts`: Integration with Lighthouse for decentralized storage.
`storacha-nfts`: Integration with Storacha for decentralized storage.
`akave-integration`: Integration with Akave for decentralized storage.

3. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

1. Copy the sample environment files, and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp packages/hardhat/.env.example packages/hardhat/.env
cp packages/nextjs/.env.example packages/nextjs/.env.local
```

2. Update the environment variables in the `.env` files with your own values.

## Using the CLI

The `create-filecoin-app` CLI tool helps you quickly set up a Filecoin-ready repository. It offers two modes: interactive mode and flag mode.

#### Interactive Mode

To use the interactive mode, simply run:

```bash
npx create-filecoin-app
```

You will be prompted to answer a series of questions to configure your new project. This includes your project name, and selecting your preferred storage onramp option (Lighthouse, or Storacha).

#### Flag Mode

If you prefer to skip the prompts, you can use the flag mode to specify your options directly. For example, to initialise a project named `my-app`, with lighthouse as the storage onramp:

```bash
npx create-filecoin-app my-app --lighthouse
```

This command initializes a new repository named `my-app` with Lighthouse as the storage onramp.

The flags available currently include:

- `--lighthouse`: this initializes a project using lighthouse as the storage onramp
- `--storacha`: this initializes a project using storacha as the storage onramp
- `--akave`: this initializes a project using akave as the storage onramp

#### Storage Onramp Options

- **Lighthouse**: Decentralized storage solution for NFTs and other data.
- **Storacha**: Decentralized hot storage network - the dazzling revitalization of Web3.Storage.
- **Akave**: L2 storage chain powering on-chain data lakes for scalable, secure, and cost-effective data management.

After running the CLI, your new project will be set up and ready for development with your chosen storage onramp.

### Configuration

1. Copy the sample environment files, and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp packages/hardhat/.env.example packages/hardhat/.env
cp packages/nextjs/.env.example packages/nextjs/.env.local
```

2. Update the environment variables in the `.env` files with your own values. (Note that the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` value is optional)

## Usage

### Deploying Smart Contracts

To compile and deploy the smart contracts:

```bash
yarn compile
yarn deploy --network calibration
```


### Running the Frontend

To start the Next.js frontend:

```bash
yarn dev
```

or

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at
[`https://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

*Fil-Frame, with the Lighthouse integration.*

## Storage Onramp Options

### Lighthouse

The repository includes a template which makes use of Lighthouse for decentralized storage, and is available in the `lighthouse-nfts` branch.

To use this integration:

1. Login to [Lighthouse](https://files.lighthouse.storage/) and generage an lighthouse API key.
2. Ensure you add the Lighthouse API key set in your `.env.local` file:
`LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_lighthouse_api_key`
3. then you can started the fil-frame app with command:
`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
4. Use the provided integration to upload files to Lighthouse

### Storacha
*Coming soon.*

### Akave
To use fil-frame with Akave integration, you need to follow the instructions to setup the env to use Akave to store data for your projects.
- Make sure you install and run docker in your machine.
- Pull the **akavelink** docker image using `docker pull akave/akavelink:latest`.
- Run the docker container to spin up a Akave local api endpoint that can be used for bucket and file operations. Learn more on [Akave docs](https://hackathon-docs.akave.ai/js-docker-example-code).
  ```
  docker run -d \
    -p 8000:3000 \
    -e NODE_ADDRESS="connect.akave.ai:5500" \
    -e PRIVATE_KEY="your_wallet_private_key" \
    akave/akavelink:latest
  ```
- In case you're using a different port for your api make sure you update `AKAVE_BACKEND_URL` in your .env file.

To learn more how to use Akave to create bucket and upload  on front-end, visit [Akave docs](https://hackathon-docs.akave.ai/js-docker-example-code#bucket-operations).

### Pyth Oracle Page
We created a pyth page to fetch filcoin price using pyth oracle and lighouse allowing users to mint an NFT for 1 dollar of FIL.
Here is the walkthrough of setuping the project and minting an NFT:
- Follow the the above instructions to setup the project locally.
- Login to [Lighthouse](https://files.lighthouse.storage/) account and ensure you add the Lighthouse API key set in your `packages/nextjs/.env.local` file: `LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_lighthouse_api_key`.
- To compile and deploy the smart contracts:

```bash
yarn compile
yarn deploy --network calibration
```
- To start the Next.js frontend:

```bash
yarn dev
```

or

```bash
npm run dev
```

The pyth page will be available at
[`https://localhost:3000/pyth`](http://localhost:3000/pyth)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9982d10-4e9a-4dc1-9a67-d8d3dcd421a8)

- There are two options to mint nft giving users option to upload images for their NFT using lighthouse storage.
- Get the tFIL token from [faucet](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/get-test-tokens).
- Here is the walkthrough to mint an NFT:

![Your setup should look like this](fil-pyth.gif)

- After confirmation from metamask, the nft will get minted.
- You can verify the transaction from the [explorer](https://calibration.filscan.io/address/t410fwuiyijiwolu2xygfasqqjgjy2f5iool67azghra/)
